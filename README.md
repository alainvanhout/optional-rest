# optional-rest-rendering

While delving into microservices and fullfledged (level 3) REST, I formed some ideas about quick and self-documenting REST via the OPTIONS verb, about an alternative approach to typical MVC controllers, and about truly logicless templates. Trying out those ideas is the only purpose of this repository, so view it the sandbox that it is. If I like what I end up with, I might move it beyond that, but we're not there yet.
